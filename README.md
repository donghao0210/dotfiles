# My .dot files

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! Dotfiles are used to customize your system and shell environment. This repository contains my personal configurations for various tools and shells, including Zsh, Vim, and others. (forked from ali-commits and modified to my own needs)

# Installation
To install these dotfiles, run the following command in your terminal. This command will download and execute a script that automatically sets up the environment on your machine.
```
curl -L bit.ly/dhconfig | bash
```
